# toDoApp with viper architecture and sqlite database

- Hello Everyone,
I wanted to make a simple "to do somethings" application with viper architecture and sqlite database.

There is a to-do list on the home page. With the add button, it goes to the new registration page and a new job is added.
When we click on any listing on the homepage, it will take us to the detail page and we can update the job.
